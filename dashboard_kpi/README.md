NLP-Powered Dashboard for Supply Chain Data
===========================================

This is a simple dashboard that allows users to query a database of supply chain data using natural language queries. The dashboard uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) from the user's query, and generates a response based on the extracted information.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use this dashboard, you will need the following:

* Python 3.x
* Dash web framework
* NLTK
* A CSV file with supply chain data

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the NLTK data and update the `nltk.download()` call in `app.py` to include the required packages.
4. Update the `data_path` variable in `app.py` to point to the location of your CSV file.
5. Start the Dash application:
```
python app.py
```

Usage
-----

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8050`.
2. Select a KPI from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter a natural language query in the input box, such as "How many backorders are there?" or "What is the average lead time?".
4. The dashboard will display a response based on the extracted KPI and value from the user's query.

Example Queries
---------------

Here are some example queries that you can use with the dashboard:

* "How many backorders are there?"
* "What is the average lead time?"
* "How well are we fulfilling orders?"
* "How quickly are we turning over inventory?"

Notes
-----

This dashboard is a simple example of how to use NLTK to power a dashboard. It is not intended to be a production-ready application, but rather a starting point for building more advanced NLP-powered dashboards.
